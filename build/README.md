# Requirements

[Node.JS and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). All installer defaults will work fine, just keep clicking next. As of writing, `node v16.13.1` and `npm 8.1.2` are in use.

After installing, run `node -v` and `npm -v` and you should get 2 version numbers above or only slightly below those listed above. If this is the case, you're good to go.

# Installation

```bash
npm install
```

# Execution

```bash
npm run start
```

You can stop the program with `Ctrl` `C`
